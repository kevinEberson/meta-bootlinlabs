+dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
+
+dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
+dnl INTLSYMBOL must be one of 'external', 'use-libtool'.
+dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages other than GNU gettext, and
+dnl    'use-libtool' for the packages 'gettext-runtime' and 'gettext-tools'.
+dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
+dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
+dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
+dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED).
+dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
+dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
+dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
+dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
+dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
+dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
+dnl    the value '$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
+dnl
+dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
+dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
+dnl    and used.
+dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
+dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
+dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
+dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
+dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
+dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
+dnl    Catalog format: none
+dnl    Catalog extension: none
+dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
+dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
+dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
+dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
+dnl maintainers.

+dnl Sets the HOST_CPU variable to the canonical name of the CPU.
+dnl Sets the HOST_CPU_C_ABI variable to the canonical name of the CPU with its
+dnl C language ABI (application binary interface).
+dnl Also defines __${HOST_CPU}__ and __${HOST_CPU_C_ABI}__ as C macros in
+dnl config.h.
+dnl
+dnl This canonical name can be used to select a particular assembly language
+dnl source file that will interoperate with C code on the given host.
+dnl
+dnl For example:
+dnl * 'i386' and 'sparc' are different canonical names, because code for i386
+dnl   will not run on SPARC CPUs and vice versa. They have different
+dnl   instruction sets.
+dnl * 'sparc' and 'sparc64' are different canonical names, because code for
+dnl   'sparc' and code for 'sparc64' cannot be linked together: 'sparc' code
+dnl   contains 32-bit instructions, whereas 'sparc64' code contains 64-bit
+dnl   instructions. A process on a SPARC CPU can be in 32-bit mode or in 64-bit
+dnl   mode, but not both.
+dnl * 'mips' and 'mipsn32' are different canonical names, because they use
+dnl   different argument passing and return conventions for C functions, and
+dnl   although the instruction set of 'mips' is a large subset of the
+dnl   instruction set of 'mipsn32'.
+dnl * 'mipsn32' and 'mips64' are different canonical names, because they use
+dnl   different sizes for the C types like 'int' and 'void *', and although
+dnl   the instruction sets of 'mipsn32' and 'mips64' are the same.
+dnl * The same canonical name is used for different endiannesses. You can
+dnl   determine the endianness through preprocessor symbols:
+dnl   - 'arm': test __ARMEL__.
+dnl   - 'mips', 'mipsn32', 'mips64': test _MIPSEB vs. _MIPSEL.
+dnl   - 'powerpc64': test _BIG_ENDIAN vs. _LITTLE_ENDIAN.
+dnl * The same name 'i386' is used for CPUs of type i386, i486, i586
+dnl   (Pentium), AMD K7, Pentium II, Pentium IV, etc., because
+dnl   - Instructions that do not exist on all of these CPUs (cmpxchg,
+dnl     MMX, SSE, SSE2, 3DNow! etc.) are not frequently used. If your
+dnl     assembly language source files use such instructions, you will
+dnl     need to make the distinction.
+dnl   - Speed of execution of the common instruction set is reasonable across
+dnl     the entire family of CPUs. If you have assembly language source files
+dnl     that are optimized for particular CPU types (like GNU gmp has), you
+dnl     will need to make the distinction.

+
+   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
+   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for 'inline void f
+   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }', c99 incorrectly complains
+   'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function'.
+   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.
+
+   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
+   on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
+   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
+   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
+   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
+   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
+   from calling static functions.  This bug is known to occur on:
+
+     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:

+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html

+
+dnl From Paul Eggert and Derek Price.
+
+dnl Sets INCLUDE_NEXT and PRAGMA_SYSTEM_HEADER.
+dnl
+dnl INCLUDE_NEXT expands to 'include_next' if the compiler supports it, or to
+dnl 'include' otherwise.
+dnl
+dnl INCLUDE_NEXT_AS_FIRST_DIRECTIVE expands to 'include_next' if the compiler
+dnl supports it in the special case that it is the first include directive in
+dnl the given file, or to 'include' otherwise.
+dnl
+dnl PRAGMA_SYSTEM_HEADER can be used in files that contain #include_next,
+dnl so as to avoid GCC warnings when the gcc option -pedantic is used.
+dnl '#pragma GCC system_header' has the same effect as if the file was found
+dnl through the include search path specified with '-isystem' options (as
+dnl opposed to the search path specified with '-I' options). Namely, gcc
+dnl does not warn about some things, and on some systems (Solaris and Interix)
+dnl __STDC__ evaluates to 0 instead of to 1. The latter is an undesired side
+dnl effect; we are therefore careful to use 'defined __STDC__' or '1' instead
+dnl of plain '__STDC__'.
+dnl
+dnl PRAGMA_COLUMNS can be used in files that override system header files, so
+dnl as to avoid compilation errors on HP NonStop systems when the gnulib file
+dnl is included by a system header file that does a "#pragma COLUMNS 80" (which
+dnl has the effect of truncating the lines of that file and all files that it
+dnl includes to 80 columns) and the gnulib file has lines longer than 80
+dnl columns.

-
-1 Overview
-**********
-
-The GNU 'hello' program (<http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/>) produces
-a familiar, friendly greeting.  It allows nonprogrammers to use a
-classic computer science tool which would otherwise be unavailable to
-them.  Because it is protected by the GNU General Public License, users
-are free (in perpetuity) to share and change it.
-
-   Not to spoil the joke, but of course the practical purpose of GNU
-Hello is to serve as a minimal example of a GNU package.  So, although
-most manuals don't need to discuss the implementation of the programs
-they document, that is part of the goal here.
-
-   First, GNU Hello follows the GNU coding standards (*note Preface:
-(standards)Top.) and GNU maintainer standards (*note Preface:
-(maintain)Top.).  These are the basic documents which all GNU packages
-should adhere to.
-
-   The Hello package also implements recommended development practices
-not embodied in the standards, using other GNU packages and features:
-
-   * It uses Automake (*note Introduction: (automake)Top.) and hence
-     also Autoconf (*note Introduction: (autoconf)Top.) for
-     configuration.
-
-   * It uses Gnulib (*note Introduction: (gnulib)Top.) to enhance
-     portability and avoid duplication of common sources.  Both
-     'gnulib-tool' and 'srclist-update' are used, for purposes of
-     example.  See the 'README-dev' file in the distribution.
-
-   * GNU Gettext (*note Introduction: (gettext)Top.) is used for
-     internationalization support.  Hello's greeting has been translated
-     into many languages.
-
-   * Internally, Hello uses the GNU 'getopt_long' function (*note
-     (libc)Getopt Long Options::) to parse options, thus supporting
-     GNU-style long options such as '--help'.
-
-   * The Hello Man page is generated with GNU 'help2man' (*note
-     Overview: (help2man)Top.) from the '--help' output.  This relieves
-     the maintainers from the burden of updating separate man
-     documentation, yet provides a reasonable overview for man devotees.
-
-   * Finally, Texinfo (*note Introduction: (texinfo)Top.) is the
-     documentation format for this manual.  It supports output in Info,
-     HTML, PDF, DVI, plain text, XML, and other formats.
-
-   GNU Hello is implemented in C.  The GNU Gettext distribution contains
-"hello world" examples in many other programming languages; see the
-Gettext home page at <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>.
-
-   The top-level 'Makefile.am' in Hello also contains a few special
-targets for other projects to adapt as desired:
-
-'diff'
-     Make a diff from the previous release, assuming the current tarball
-     is in the current tarball.
-
-'po-check'
-     Verify that all source files using '_()' are included for
-     translation in 'po/POTFILES.in', so translators will have all the
-     messages.
-
-'wwwdoc'
-     Sample procedure for updating the manual on the GNU web site, in
-     this case <http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/>.
-
-   GNU Hello was written by Mike Haertel, David MacKenzie, Jan
-Brittenson, Charles Hannum, Roland McGrath, Noah Friedman, Karl
-Eichwalder, Karl Berry, and The King.

-2 Sample output
-***************
-
-Here are some examples of running GNU Hello.
-
-   This is the output of the command 'hello':
-
-     Hello, world!
-
-   This is the output of the command 'hello --traditional':
-
-     hello, world
-
-   This is the output of the command 'hello --greeting=hi':
-
-     hi

-
-3 Invoking 'hello'
-******************
-
-The format for running the 'hello' program is:
-
-     hello OPTION ...
-
-   With no options, 'hello' prints the greeting 'Hello, world!'.
-
-   'hello' supports the following options:
-
-'--greeting=TEXT'
-'-g TEXT'
-     Output TEXT instead of the default greeting.
-
-'--help'
-'-h'
-     Print an informative help message on standard output and exit
-     successfully.
-
-     For the '--help' output of GNU programs, it's strongly encouraged
-     to include a brief (one or two sentences) description of what the
-     program does, as well as the synopsis of how to run the program.
-     Any environment variables which affect execution should also be
-     mentioned (Hello doesn't have any).
-
-'--traditional'
-'-t'
-     Output the traditional greeting message 'hello, world'.
-
-'--version'
-'-v'
-     Print the version number and licensing information of Hello on
-     standard output and then exit successfully.
-
-   If more than one of the greeting options ('-g', '-t', and their
-long-named equivalents) is specified, whichever comes last takes
-precedence.

-4 Reporting bugs
-****************
-
-To report bugs, suggest enhancements or otherwise discuss GNU Hello,
-please send electronic mail to <bug-hello@gnu.org>.
-
-   For bug reports, please include enough information for the
-maintainers to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
-
-   * The version numbers of Hello (which you can find by running
-     'hello --version') and any other program(s) or manual(s) involved.
-   * Hardware and operating system names and versions.
-   * The contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
-   * The expected behavior and/or output.
-   * A description of the problem and samples of any erroneous output.
-   * Options you gave to 'configure' other than specifying installation
-     directories.
-   * Anything else that you think would be helpful.
-
-   When in doubt whether something is needed or not, include it.  It's
-better to include too much than to leave out something important.
-
-   Patches are welcome; if possible, please make them with 'diff -c'
-(*note Overview: (diff)Top.) and include 'ChangeLog' entries (*note
-(emacs)Change Log::).  Please follow the existing coding style.

-Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
-*****************************************
-
-                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
-
-     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-     <http://fsf.org/>
-
-     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-  0. PREAMBLE
-
-     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
-     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
-     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
-     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
-     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
-     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
-     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
-
-     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
-     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
-     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
-     license designed for free software.
-
-     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
-     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
-     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
-     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
-     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
-     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
-     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
-     instruction or reference.
-
-  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
-
-     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
-     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
-     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
-     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
-     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
-     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
-     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
-     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
-     requiring permission under copyright law.
-
-     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
-     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
-     modifications and/or translated into another language.
-
-     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
-     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
-     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
-     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
-     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
-     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
-     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
-     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
-     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
-     regarding them.
-
-     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
-     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
-     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
-     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
-     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
-     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
-     any Invariant Sections then there are none.
-
-     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
-     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
-     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
-     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
-     be at most 25 words.
-
-     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
-     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
-     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
-     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
-     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
-     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
-     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
-     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
-     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
-     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
-     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
-     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
-     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
-
-     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
-     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
-     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
-     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
-     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
-     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
-     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
-     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
-     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
-     processors for output purposes only.
-
-     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
-     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
-     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
-     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
-     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
-     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
-
-     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
-     of the Document to the public.
-
-     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
-     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
-     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
-     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
-     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
-     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
-     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
-     to this definition.
-
-     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
-     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
-     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
-     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
-     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
-     has no effect on the meaning of this License.
-
-  2. VERBATIM COPYING
-
-     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
-     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
-     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
-     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
-     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
-     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
-     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
-     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
-     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
-     conditions in section 3.
-
-     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
-     and you may publicly display copies.
-
-  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
-
-     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
-     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
-     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
-     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
-     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
-     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
-     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
-     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
-     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
-     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
-     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
-     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
-
-     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
-     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
-     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
-     adjacent pages.
-
-     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
-     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
-     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
-     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
-     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
-     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
-     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
-     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
-     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
-     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
-     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
-     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
-
-     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
-     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
-     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
-     Document.
-
-  4. MODIFICATIONS
-
-     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
-     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
-     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
-     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
-     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
-     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
-     the Modified Version:
-
-       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
-          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
-          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
-          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
-          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
-          version gives permission.
-
-       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
-          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
-          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
-          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
-          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
-          from this requirement.
-
-       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
-          Modified Version, as the publisher.
-
-       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
-
-       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
-          adjacent to the other copyright notices.
-
-       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
-          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
-          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
-          the Addendum below.
-
-       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
-          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
-          license notice.
-
-       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
-
-       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
-          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
-          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
-          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
-          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
-          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
-          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
-          previous sentence.
-
-       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
-          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
-          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
-          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
-          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
-          that was published at least four years before the Document
-          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
-          to gives permission.
-
-       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
-          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
-          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
-          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
-
-       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
-          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
-          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
-
-       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
-          may not be included in the Modified Version.
-
-       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
-          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
-          Section.
-
-       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
-
-     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
-     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
-     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
-     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
-     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
-     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
-     section titles.
-
-     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
-     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
-     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
-     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
-     definition of a standard.
-
-     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
-     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
-     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
-     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
-     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
-     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
-     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
-     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
-     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
-     the old one.
-
-     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
-     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
-     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
-
-  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
-
-     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
-     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
-     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
-     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
-     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
-     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
-     their Warranty Disclaimers.
-
-     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
-     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
-     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
-     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
-     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
-     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
-     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
-     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
-     combined work.
-
-     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
-     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
-     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
-     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
-     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."
-
-  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
-
-     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
-     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
-     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
-     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
-     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
-     in all other respects.
-
-     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
-     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
-     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
-     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
-     document.
-
-  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
-
-     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
-     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
-     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
-     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
-     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
-     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
-     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
-     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
-
-     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
-     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
-     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
-     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
-     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
-     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
-     the whole aggregate.
-
-  8. TRANSLATION
-
-     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
-     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
-     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
-     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
-     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
-     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
-     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
-     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
-     include the original English version of this License and the
-     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
-     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
-     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
-     prevail.
-
-     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
-     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
-     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
-     actual title.
-
-  9. TERMINATION
-
-     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
-     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
-     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-
-     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
-     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
-     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
-     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
-     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
-     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
-
-     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
-     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
-     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
-     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
-     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
-     after your receipt of the notice.
-
-     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
-     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
-     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
-     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
-     same material does not give you any rights to use it.
-
-  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
-
-     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
-     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
-     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
-     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
-     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.
-
-     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
-     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
-     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
-     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
-     that specified version or of any later version that has been
-     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
-     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
-     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
-     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
-     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
-     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
-     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
-
-  11. RELICENSING
-
-     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
-     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
-     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
-     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
-     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
-     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
-     site.
-
-     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
-     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
-     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
-     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
-     published by that same organization.
-
-     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
-     in part, as part of another Document.
-
-     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
-     License, and if all works that were first published under this
-     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
-     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
-     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
-     to November 1, 2008.
-
-     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
-     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
-     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
-
-ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
-====================================================
-
-To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
-the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
-notices just after the title page:
-
-       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
-       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
-       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
-       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
-       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
-       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
-       Free Documentation License''.
-
-   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
-Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
-
-         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
-         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
-         being LIST.
-
-   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
-combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
-situation.
-
-   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
-recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
-software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
-their use in free software.

-dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
-
-dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
-dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
-dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
-dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
-dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
-dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
-dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
-dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
-dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
-dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
-dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
-dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
-dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
-dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
-dnl    the value '$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
-dnl
-dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
-dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
-dnl    and used.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
-dnl    Catalog format: none
-dnl    Catalog extension: none
-dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
-dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
-dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
-dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
-dnl maintainers.
